## About the Video Course
Unity’s User Interface System has a wide variety of features. In this course we'll be covering some of the ways that those features can be used to build more complex UI systems for your games. From Animation to writing Editor scripts, this course covers a variety of topics that will expand your knowledge of the UI system, giving you the power to build your own reusable components and extend the UI system further.

The course content is split into four sections, with each taking on topics that will improve your UI development skills. Animating world-space canvases as in-game displays and as damage indicators, building reusable elements for menus such as inventory items, things to look out for when designing for multiple platforms, devices and resolutions, and how to instantiate canvas objects correctly. By covering these topics you will come to a greater understanding of how the UI system works as a whole, and learn new ways to improve your skills.
